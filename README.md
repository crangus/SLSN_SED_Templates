# SLSN_SED_Templates
**SLSNe SED templates used in Angus et al. 2019, Frohmaier et al. 2021**

These are empirical templates of SLSNe averaged from 110 rest-frame spectra of SLSNe-I first presented in Inserra et al. 2018d. 

The templates correspond to typical SLSNe SEDs at temperatures of 15000K, 12000K, 10000K, 8000K and 6000K. These corresponding to the following approximate phases from peak respectively
```
  15000K: phase < 10 days (file: FullCoverage_15000K.txt)
  12000K: 10 < phase < 15 day (file: FullCoverage_12000K.txt)
  10000K: 15 <phase < 22 days (file: FullCoverage_10000K.txt)
  8000K:  22 < phase < 35 days (file: FullCoverage_8000K.txt)
  6000K:  phase > 35 days (file: FullCoverage_6000K.txt)
```

All templates cover the wavelength range 900.0-23850.0 Angstrom, and are normalised such that they can be superimposed upon a featureless blackbody spectrum of the corresponding temperature.
